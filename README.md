# health-desk-chatbot

This project implements a chat bot using Flask and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. The chat bot allows users to interact with the bot by selecting health conditions, severity levels, and providing additional messages. The bot provides responses based on the user input and stores the conversation history using ConversationBufferMemory.
